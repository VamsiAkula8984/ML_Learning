      "    Climate-related risks, their impacts, and a public company's \n",

      "financial performance and position.\\3\\ Accordingly, many investors and \n",
      "those acting on their behalf--including investment advisers and \n",
      "investment management companies--currently seek information to assess \n",
      "how climate-related risks affect a registrant's business and financial \n",
      "condition and thus the price of the registrant's securities. Investors \n",
      "also seek climate-related information to assess a registrant's \n",
      "management and board oversight of climate-related risks so as to inform \n",
      "their investment and voting decisions. In light of these investor \n",
      "needs, the Commission is adopting rules to require registrants to \n",
      "provide certain information about climate-related risks that have \n",
      "materially impacted, or are reasonably likely to have a material impact \n",
      "on, the registrant's business strategy, results of operations, or \n",

      "Accordingly, the Commission proposed to amend Regulation S-K to add a \n",
      "new subpart 1500 that would require a registrant to disclose: any \n",
      "material climate-related impacts on its strategy, business model, and \n",

      "    The Commission also proposed to amend Regulation S-X to add a new \n",

      "disclose in a note to its financial statements certain disaggregated \n",
      "climate-related financial statement metrics.\\91\\ The proposed rules \n",
      "would have required disclosure falling under the following three \n",

      "risk management, and metrics and targets.\\94\\ The Commission proposed \n",

      "operating prospects and financial performance and, therefore, should be \n",
      "presented together with other disclosure about the registrant's \n",

      "that climate-related risks can have material impacts on companies' \n",
      "financial position or performance.\\99\\ Commenters indicated that when \n",
      "it is available, information about climate-related risks is currently \n",

      "inform investment decision-making.\\100\\ Some commenters provided \n",
      "specific examples of how that type of information helps investors make \n",
      "investment decisions today.\\101\\ However, many commenters stated that \n",
      "the Commission's current reporting requirements do not yield adequate \n",
      "or sufficient information regarding climate-related risks.\\102\\ Many \n",
      "commenters also expressed the view that the current, largely voluntary \n",
      "reporting of climate-related information under various third-party \n",
      "frameworks, which differ in certain respects, has allowed registrants \n",
      "to selectively choose which climate-related disclosures to provide and \n",

      "information with the level of detail needed by investors to assess the \n",
      "financial impact of climate-related risks on registrants.\\103\\ \n",
      "Commenters stated that, despite the Commission's issuance of the 2010 \n",
      "Guidance, registrants often provided climate-related disclosure that is \n",
      "boilerplate, with some being or bordering on ``greenwashing.'' \\104\\ \n",

      "ensure securities are priced to better reflect climate-related \n",

      "reliability of climate-related information, which would facilitate \n",
      "investors' comparison of climate-related risks and lead to more \n",

      "\n",
      "    The Commission considers the provisions of the final rules to be \n",
      "severable to the fullest extent permitted by law. ``If parts of a \n",
      "regulation are invalid and other parts are not,'' courts ``set aside \n",
      "only the invalid parts unless the remaining ones cannot operate by \n",
      "themselves or unless the agency manifests an intent for the entire \n",
      "package to rise or fall together.'' Bd. of Cnty. Commissioners of Weld \n",

      "Non-Violence v. Turner, 893 F.2d 1387, 1394 (D.C. Cir. 1990). \n",
      "Consistent with these principles, while the Commission believes that \n",
      "all provisions of the final rules are fully consistent with governing \n",
      "law, if any of the provisions of these rules, or the application \n",
      "thereof to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the \n",
      "Commission intends that such invalidity shall not affect other \n",
      "provisions or application of such provisions to other persons or \n",
      "circumstances that can be given effect without the invalid provision or \n",
      "application. For instance, but without limitation, each of the \n",
      "following portions of the final rules serves distinct but related \n",
      "purposes and is capable of operating independently: (1) climate-related \n",
      "risk disclosures, (2) targets and goals disclosures, (3) GHG emissions \n",
      "disclosures and assurance, and (4) Article 14 financial statement \n",
      "disclosures. Moreover, many of the required disclosure items in the \n",
      "final rules operate independently in that not all registrants are \n",
      "required to provide each of the required disclosures, and some \n",
      "disclosures will only be provided to the extent applicable. For \n",
      "example, disclosures related to a registrant's use of transition plans, \n",
      "scenario analysis, or internal carbon prices would depend upon a \n",
      "registrant's activities, if any, to mitigate or adapt to material \n",
      "climate-related risks. Similarly, governance disclosures would only be \n",
      "required to the extent that a registrant has information responsive to \n",

      "requirements will apply only with respect to LAFs and AFs (other than \n",
